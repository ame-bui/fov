        Fragments of Vietnam is an archive for and by the community living in Vietnam. The project is an evergrowing record of the community responses to the question "What's ones experience living in Vietnam?", and an attempt to explore and represent the more "unofficial" voices of Vietnam as it move away from the traditional archiving methods and institutionalized archives.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        <em>The project is still currently in its developing process by Amelia Hương Bùi, as part of her thesis project about archives, surrounding the question: "How can archives be tools for reframing and preserving community memory, specifically in Vietnamese context?".</em><br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The project also acts as a possible answer to the questions set out in Randa Hadi &amp; Victoria Gerson's essay "Why community archives are a radical approach to archiving?" in the context of Vietnam and its communities, especially in the current contemporary moment.</em>
